# MVC Project Template

## What is it?
Project template for creating applications when a full framework like laravel or Symfony are just to heavy.

But you still want the goodness of Composer, MVC, Routing, Templating and ORM.

## Getting Started 
To get you going theres a vagrant box and some example scripts.

* Pull this project to a local dir
* vagrant up 
* At the client command line run.
    * cd /var/www
    * composer update 
* go to 
    * localhost:8080
    * or localhost:8080/secure
